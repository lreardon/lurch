## Equal JSON objects

By a "JSON object" I mean an object where the only information we care about
is that which would be preserved by `JSON.stringify` (i.e., an object that
can be serialized and deserialized with JSON's `stringify` and `parse`
without bringing any harm to our data).

We wish to be able to compare such objects for semantic equality (not actual
equality of objects in memory, as `==` would do).  We cannot simply do this
by comparing the `JSON.stringify` of each, because [documentation on
JSON.stringify](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify)
says that we cannot rely on a consistent ordering of the object keys.  Thus
we implement the following comparison routine.

Note that this only works for objects that fit the requirements above; if
equality (in your situation) is affected by the prototype chain, or if your
object contains functions, or any other similar difficulty, then this
routine is not guaranteed to work for you.

It yields the same result as `JSON.stringify(x) is JSON.stringify(y)` would
if `stringify` always gave the same ordering of object keys.

    JSON.equals = ( x, y ) ->

If only one is an object, or only one is an array, then they're not equal.
If neither is an object, you can use plain simple `is` to compare.

        return no if ( x instanceof Object ) isnt ( y instanceof Object )
        return no if ( x instanceof Array ) isnt ( y instanceof Array )
        if x not instanceof Object then return x is y

So now we know that both inputs are objects.

Get their keys in a consistent order.  If they aren't the same for both
objects, then the objects aren't equal.

        xkeys = ( Object.keys x ).sort()
        ykeys = ( Object.keys y ).sort()
        return no if ( JSON.stringify xkeys ) isnt ( JSON.stringify ykeys )

If there's any key on which the objects don't match, then they aren't equal.
Otherwise, they are.

        for key in xkeys
            if not JSON.equals x[key], y[key] then return no
        yes
