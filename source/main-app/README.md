# Lurch Main App

The files in this folder were migrated from
[our old repository](https://github.com/nathancarter/weblurch) and have not
been changed since.  You can see the *old* version in any of these ways:
 * [Live app](http://nathancarter.github.io/weblurch/app/app.html)
 * [Source code](https://github.com/nathancarter/weblurch/blob/master/app/main-app-basics-solo.litcoffee)
 * [Documentation](http://nathancarter.github.io/weblurch/docs/), including
   the [User Guide](http://nathancarter.github.io/weblurch/docs/user-guide/)

We have not yet updated this code to function in this new repository because
we are currently doing a major redesign, and some of the interface will be
changed for the better.  Check back in 2018 for more!
