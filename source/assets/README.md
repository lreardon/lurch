Some of the files in this folder and its subfolders were taken from other
projects, with gratitude.  I give credit for those borrowings here.

See [the README file in that folder](eqed/README.md) for details.

These were generated by the Lurch authors

Thanks to [the lean.js project](https://github.com/leanprover/lean.js) for
