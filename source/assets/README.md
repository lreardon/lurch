# Assets folder

Some of the files in this folder and its subfolders were taken from other
projects, with gratitude.  I give credit for those borrowings here.

## `eqed` folder: Third-party Equation Editor Plugin

The files in the `eqed` folder were taken from the example folder in [this
project on GitHub](https://github.com/foraker/tinymce_equation_editor).
Minor modifications were made to integrate them into this project.

In keeping with the license of that project (MIT license), we include this
text, giving credit to the origins of the code in that folder, and include a
copy of that license in the `eqed` folder.

## `icons` folder: App icons

These were generated by the Lurch authors

## `images` folder: Images used in the app

These were generated by the Lurch authors

## `input-method.js`: Table of symbols to replace in text

Thanks to [the lean.js project](https://github.com/leanprover/lean.js) for
this freely available file.
